# ColabDesign for Cyclic Peptide Binder Hallucination (WIP)
This repository is based on the AfDesign binder hallucination protocol from ColabDesign, published by Dr. Sergey Ovchinnikov on [GitHub](https://github.com/sokrypton/ColabDesign/tree/main/af).

Cyclic peptide complex offset was applied to AfDesign to enable hallucination of cyclic peptide binders to target proteins.

## About Cyclic Peptide Complex Offset

Cyclic peptide complex offset is an offset for structure prediction and hallucination of protein-cyclic peptide complex.

Example of relative position encoding of a hypothetical 20-residue protein and a 10-residue peptide. Default complex offset on the left and cyclic peptide complex offset on the right.
